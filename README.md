# Wicca-coven
I'm currently trying to add a Meme to Rimworld/Ideology, but I'm stuck and I hope to get some help here.
My current goal is adding names for deities as well as making little name packs.
Also, it seems the pawns don't convert after completing the ritual and the ritual doesn't add any IdeoPoints. I can't find any help on the Internet for that... dang.
I'm referring some Code on Oskar Potocki's Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Memes and Structures as well as ThesePeople's Custom Ritual Framework.
