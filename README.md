# Wicca-coven
I'm currently trying to add a Meme to Rimworld/Ideology, but I'm stuck and I hope to get some help here.
My current goal is changing the structure and required precepts. Later I want to add rituals and descriptions as well as adding names for deities.
I'm referring some Code on Oskar Potocki's Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Memes and Structures.
