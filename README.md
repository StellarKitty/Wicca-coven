# Wicca-coven
I'm currently trying to add a Meme to Rimworld/Ideology, but I'm stuck and I hope to get some help here.
My current goal is to let it show in the  Tab, and I can't figure out why it doesn't show up. Until that happens, I don't know what else to do.
I'm referring some Code on Oskar Potocki's Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Memes and Structures.
just testing some stuff
